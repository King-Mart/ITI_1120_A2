now the full star (*) row is the header and the footer in between which we insert the subheader and the prefooter which are the same but with blank spaces i between the initial and the final star.

This can easily be implemented inside a lambda function
Thus I leveraged list operations to beautifully resolve this string concatenation problem"""
